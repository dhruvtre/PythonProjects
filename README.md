The calculator contains the following functions:

1. **add(a, b):** This function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.
2. **subtract(a, b):** This function takes in two numbers and returns the result of the first number subtracted by the second number.
3. **multiply(a, b):** This function takes in two numbers and returns their product.
4. **divide(a, b):** This function takes in two numbers and returns the result of the first number divided by the second number.
